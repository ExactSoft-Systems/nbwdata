Other financing mechanisms (e.g. loans and leases) simply charge you a fixed payment, so that you bear the risk of project performance. The tradeoff is that financing options without a performance guarantee can sometimes be cheaper. If you do not wish to bear the risk of project performance or you have stakeholders in your organization who do not want to bear performance risk, select “important” or “required.” If your organization is confident in the return on investment from the project and you are open to fixed payments, select “not important.”Bear in mind that if the financing option you use does not automatically include a performance guarantee, performance insurance can usually be purchased separately.',

Note that there are no cut-and-dried rules for balance sheet treatment and the final decision on how to treat any given project rests with your accounting team.Reasons your organization may want off-balance sheet treatment include:- You already have significant debt on your balance sheet and do not wish to take on more to avoid affecting your credit- You have limits on the amount of debt you can take on, either in absolute terms or in relation to other financial metrics (e.g. debt service capacity ratio limits).- On-balance sheet debt requires higher-level approval within your organizationReasons your organization may prefer on-balance sheet financing include:- You wish to book the installed equipment as an asset on your balance sheet and are willing to accept the corresponding liability to do so- You wish to claim depreciation benefits on the assetReasons to select "not important" include:- You are indifferent to balance sheet treatment and wish to get the best deal availableThe information in the Navigator summarizes typical practices in the market, as reported in industry research.

Advantages of shorter-term financing are that you end your obligation to the provider faster and, in cases where you will continue to own and operate the equipment after the financing is repaid, you can enjoy 100% of the cost-savings from the project for the remainder of its useful life. Advantages of longer-term financing are that it spreads your payments over a longer period of time and, in many cases, results in a lower annual or monthly payment, making the project more cashflow positive for you in the short run.',

The tradeoff is that, while simpler contracts are easier to understand and negotiate, more complicated contracts are sometimes necessary to provide more value to you (e.g. performance guarantees, lower interest rates).If your organization is sensitive to contract complexity, select "Important," and if complexity must be kept at an absolute minimum, select "Required."
